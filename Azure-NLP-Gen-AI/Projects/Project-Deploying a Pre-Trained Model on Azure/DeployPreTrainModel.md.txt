Project: Deploying a Pre-Trained Model on Azure
Objective:
Design and implement a fine-tuned solution using Azure Machine Learning tools. Showcase how fine-tuning enhances the performance of a pre-trained model for a specific task.

Project Steps
Define Your Task
Choose a task for which fine-tuning is critical:
Example: Legal document summarization, sentiment analysis, or question answering.
Clearly outline the task’s objective, dataset requirements, and expected outcomes.
Prepare Your Dataset
Collect a dataset relevant to your task.
Preprocess the dataset (e.g., clean, normalize, split into training, validation, and test sets).
Upload the dataset to Azure Blob Storage or Dataset Manager.
Select and Fine-Tune a Pre-Trained Model
Choose a pre-trained model from Azure’s catalog (e.g., GPT, BERT).
Write a training script specifying hyperparameters like learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size.
Leverage Azure’s DeepSpeed and ONNX Runtime for efficient training.
Monitor the training process using Azure’s real-time metrics dashboard.
Evaluate Your Fine-Tuned Model
Use performance metrics like F1-Score, accuracy, or BLEU scores.
Perform error analysis to identify areas for improvement.
Deploy Your Model
Set up an API endpoint using Azure Machine Learning’s real-time deployment feature.
Test the API by integrating it into a sample application (e.g., a chatbot or review analyzer).
Monitor performance in real-time using Azure’s monitoring tools.
Write a Report
Include the following sections:
Task Definition: Objective and significance of the task.
Dataset Insights: Description of the dataset preparation process.
Model Training Summary: Details of the fine-tuning process.
Evaluation Results: Metrics and analysis of model performance.
Deployment: Steps taken to deploy and test the model.
Future Improvements: Suggestions for further enhancing the solution.
Happy Fine-Tuning with Azure!
