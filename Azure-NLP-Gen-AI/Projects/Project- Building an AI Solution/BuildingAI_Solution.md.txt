Project: Building an AI Solution
Project: Building an AI Solution with the Model Catalog
Objective:
Design and implement an AI solution using a pre-trained model from the Azure AI Studio Model Catalog. Showcase how the model can be selected, managed, and applied effectively to solve a specific task.

Project Steps
Define Your AI Task
Choose a task such as:

Customer service chatbot
Sentiment analysis of product reviews
Language translation for international users
Clearly define the task, expected outcomes, and real-world applications. 
Explore the Model Catalog
Browse the Model Catalog in Azure AI Studio and select a pre-trained model that best fits your task.
Identify the provider of the model (Microsoft, OpenAI, or Hugging Face).
Justify your model selection based on task alignment, performance metrics, and customizability.
Manage Your Model
Use Azure AI Studio to:
Organize and label the model.
Implement version control to track changes.
Share the model setup with collaborators.
Develop Your AI Solution
Implement the model for your chosen task by following these steps:
Input data preparation: Preprocess data for your AI task.
Model integration: Use the Azure AI Studio to deploy and run the model.
Output evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance on your dataset.
Evaluate Your Solution
Evaluate the solution using metrics such as accuracy for sentiment analysis or BLEU scores for translation. Highlight any challenges or limitations encountered during implementation.
Write a Report
Include the following sections:
Task Definition: Objective, significance, and real-world relevance.
Model Selection: Explanation of why the chosen model fits the task.
Management Process: Steps taken to organize and manage the model.
Solution Development: Description of the implementation process.
Evaluation Results: Metrics and analysis of model performance.
Future Improvements: Suggestions for enhancing the solution.
Happy Building with Azure AI Studio!
