Project: LLM Application with Prompt Flow
Project: Developing and Maintaining an LLM Application with Prompt Flow
Objective:
Design and implement an LLM-based application using Azure’s prompt flow tools. Demonstrate how prompt flow structures the application, monitor its performance, and maintain it for scalability and efficiency.

Project Steps
Define Your Use Case
Choose a use case for your application:
Example: Customer support chatbot, content generator, or data summarization tool.
Clearly outline the objective and expected outcomes.
Design the Prompt Flow
Use Azure’s visual editor to define the flow components:
Input Nodes: Capture and preprocess user inputs.
Model Nodes: Process inputs and generate outputs using LLMs.
Output Nodes: Deliver structured results to users.
Integrate external APIs or logic if necessary.
Provide a diagram or description of the flow structure.
Prototype the Application
Implement the flow using Azure tools.
Test the application to identify and fix inconsistencies.
Experiment with different prompts to optimize LLM responses.
Monitor and Maintain the Application
Set up monitoring to track latency, error rates, and usage patterns.
Collect and analyze user feedback to refine prompts or improve workflows.
Use version control to manage updates and test new features.
Evaluate and Improve
Evaluate the application’s performance using metrics like error rates and response times.
Document areas of improvement and update the flow accordingly.
Write a Report
Include the following sections:
Task Definition: Use case and objectives.
Prompt Flow Design: Components and their roles.
Prototype Summary: Steps and challenges in building the application.
Monitoring Insights: Metrics and feedback analysis.
Future Improvements: Suggestions for enhancing the application.
Happy Developing with Azure Prompt Flow!
