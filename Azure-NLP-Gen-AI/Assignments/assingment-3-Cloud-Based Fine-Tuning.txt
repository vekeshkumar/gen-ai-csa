Assignment: Cloud-Based Fine-Tuning
Assignment Objectives:
By completing this assignment, you should be able to:

Understand the principles and process of fine-tuning pre-trained models.
Analyze the benefits and challenges of fine-tuning.
Evaluate and deploy fine-tuned models effectively.
Part 1: Fundamentals of Fine-Tuning
Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions):

What is the key benefit of fine-tuning a pre-trained model?
A) It reduces the need for computational resources (Correct Answer)
B) It avoids using training data
C) It removes the need for evaluation
D) It simplifies deployment

Which of the following tools optimizes model deployment in Azure?
A) ONNX Runtime (Correct Answer)
B) TensorBoard
C) Google Sheets
D) SQL Server

Application Task:
Identify three potential tasks for which fine-tuning can be applied (e.g., legal document summarization, sentiment analysis, or image captioning).

For each task:
Describe the specific pre-trained model you would choose (e.g., GPT, BERT).
Explain why fine-tuning is beneficial for that task.
Part 2: Implementing Fine-Tuning on Azure
Case Study Activity:
Select a pre-trained model from Azure AI Studio’s catalog and fine-tune it for a specific task (e.g., chatbot for customer service or a sentiment analysis tool).

Describe the dataset you would use and how you would prepare it.
Write a 200-word reflection on how you would evaluate the model’s performance after fine-tuning, including metrics you would use and challenges you might face.
Part 3: Evaluating and Deploying Models
Concept Check (True/False):

Fine-tuning eliminates the need for evaluation metrics. (False)
Azure Machine Learning provides tools for real-time monitoring of deployed models. (True)
Reflection Activity:
In 150–200 words, discuss the importance of evaluating a fine-tuned model using metrics like F1-Score and cross-validation. Provide examples of potential pitfalls if evaluation is skipped or poorly executed.

Summary:
This assignment will test your understanding of:

The fine-tuning process and its importance.
Implementation strategies using Azure’s tools.
Evaluation and deployment techniques for fine-tuned models.
