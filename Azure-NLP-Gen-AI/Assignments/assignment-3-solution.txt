Part 1:
Application Task:

Here are three potential tasks for which fine-tuning can be applied, along with the rationale for each:

Legal Document Summarization

Pre-trained Model: A large language model like a Llama model.

Why Fine-tuning Is Beneficial: Legal documents are often long and complex, with specific terminology and structure. Fine-tuning a Llama model on a dataset of legal texts and summaries can enable it to generate concise, accurate summaries that capture the key points, saving legal professionals significant time.

Sentiment Analysis for Social Media

Pre-trained Model: A transformer model like a DistilBERT or RoBERTa.

Why Fine-tuning Is Beneficial: Social media text is characterized by its informal language, slang, and brevity. Fine-tuning a model like DistilBERT on a dataset of social media posts labeled with sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) can significantly improve its accuracy in understanding the nuances of online communication.

Image Captioning for a Specific Domain

Pre-trained Model: A vision-language model.

Why Fine-tuning Is Beneficial: While pre-trained vision-language models can generate general image captions, fine-tuning them on a dataset of images and captions from a specific domain (e.g., medical images, e-commerce product photos) can greatly enhance their ability to generate accurate and relevant captions for that particular area.

Implementing Fine-Tuning on Azure

Case Study Activity:

Let's consider fine-tuning a pre-trained model from Azure AI Studio's catalog for a customer service chatbot.

Pre-trained Model: We would choose a GPT model from OpenAI, available in the Azure AI Model Catalog. GPT models are well-suited for conversational tasks due to their ability to understand natural language and generate coherent responses.

Dataset and Preparation:

We would create a dataset of customer service conversations, including:

Customer inquiries (e.g., "How do I return a product?", "What is my order status?")

Agent responses (e.g., step-by-step instructions, order information).

The data would be prepared as follows:

Text cleaning: Removing irrelevant characters, correcting typos.

Dialogue structuring: Formatting conversations into turns with clear speaker identification.

Data augmentation: Potentially paraphrasing questions or generating synthetic conversations to increase dataset size and robustness.

Splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Evaluation and Challenges:

After fine-tuning, we would evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as:

Customer satisfaction: Measured through surveys or ratings after interacting with the chatbot.

Task completion rate: The percentage of customer issues successfully resolved by the chatbot.

Response relevance and fluency: Assessed by human evaluators or using metrics like BLEU or ROUGE.

Error rate: The frequency of incorrect or nonsensical responses.

Challenges we might face include:

Data scarcity: Obtaining a sufficiently large and high-quality dataset of customer service conversations.

Overfitting: The model may memorize the training data and perform poorly on new, unseen conversations.

Handling diverse customer language: Customers may express themselves in various ways, including with slang, typos, or emotional language.

Ensuring ethical and unbiased responses: The chatbot should avoid generating offensive, discriminatory, or unhelpful content.

Part 3:
Evaluating and Deploying Models:

It's very important to evaluate a fine-tuned model using metrics like F1-Score and cross-validation. The F1-score provides a balanced measure of a model's precision and recall, which is especially useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Cross-validation, on the other hand, is a technique that assesses how well a model generalizes to unseen data by training and validating it on multiple subsets of the dataset.

If you skip evaluation or do it poorly, you could run into several issues. For example, the model might perform well on the training data but fail miserably in real-world scenarios. This is known as overfitting. Also, if you don't use appropriate metrics, you might get a false sense of the model's performance. For instance, accuracy can be misleading if the classes are imbalanced.

Poor evaluation can also lead to the deployment of a biased or unreliable model, which can have serious consequences depending on the application.
