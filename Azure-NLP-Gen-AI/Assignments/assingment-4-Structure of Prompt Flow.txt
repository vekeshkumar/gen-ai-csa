Assignment: Structure of Prompt Flow
Assignment Objectives:
By completing this assignment, you should be able to:

Understand the role and structure of prompt flow in LLM applications.
Analyze challenges in monitoring and maintaining LLM applications.
Design and prototype a functional LLM application using Azure’s prompt flow tools.
Part 1: Fundamentals of Prompt Flow
Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions):

What is the purpose of prompt flow in LLM applications?
A) To design how inputs are structured and processed (Correct Answer)
B) To train new models
C) To monitor external APIs
D) To evaluate usage patterns

Which feature of Azure supports prompt flow testing?
A) Integrated Debugging (Correct Answer)
B) SQL Query Tools
C) Image Recognition Modules
D) Cloud Storage Optimization

Application Task:
Describe the steps involved in building an LLM application with prompt flow. Identify a use case (e.g., content generation or customer support chatbot) and outline:

The inputs, prompts, and outputs for the application.
The integrations or APIs needed.
Part 2: Building LLM Applications
Case Study Activity:
Using Azure’s visual editor, design a prototype for a content generation tool that accepts a user topic and generates a blog post draft.

Explain the components of your prompt flow:
Input nodes (user topic).
Model nodes (LLM generating the draft).
Output nodes (displaying the draft).
Write a 200-word reflection on the challenges you faced in designing this flow and how you overcame them using Azure’s tools.
Part 3: Monitoring and Maintaining LLM Applications
Concept Check (True/False):

Monitoring ensures application performance and helps identify potential issues. (True)
Version control is not necessary for maintaining LLM applications. (False)
Reflection Activity:
In 150–200 words, discuss how monitoring metrics like latency and error rates help improve the user experience of an LLM application. Provide examples of tools or strategies that can be used for effective monitoring in Azure.

Summary:
This assignment will test your understanding of:

The structure and purpose of prompt flow.
Designing and prototyping LLM applications.
Monitoring and maintaining LLM applications.
