Assignment: Exploring NLP in Cloud
Assignment Objectives:
By completing this assignment, you should be able to:

Understand the principles of NLP and its evolution.
Analyze the significance of transformer models in NLP.
Evaluate the impact of cloud-based NLP solutions in real-world applications.
Part 1: Fundamentals of NLP
Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions):

Which of the following best describes NLP?
A) Teaching machines to process human language (Correct Answer)
B) Creating speech recognition hardware
C) Optimizing database queries
D) Simulating physical environments

Why are transformer models preferred over traditional rule-based NLP systems?
A) They require less computation power
B) They are capable of understanding context through self-attention (Correct Answer)
C) They don’t need data to function
D) They are based on fixed rules

Application Task:
List three real-world applications of cloud-based NLP, such as virtual assistants, sentiment analysis tools, and translation services.

For each application:
Describe its purpose and functionality.
Provide an example of a tool or service (e.g., Google Translate for machine translation).
Part 2: Exploring Transformer Models
Case Study Activity:
Select a cloud-based NLP tool or service (e.g., Amazon Comprehend, Google NLP API).

Analyze its functionality:
What type of NLP tasks does it perform?
How does it leverage transformers for better results?
Write a 200-word reflection discussing how this tool benefits users and industries.
Part 3: Ethical Considerations in NLP
Concept Check (True/False):

Cloud-based NLP solutions eliminate privacy concerns. (False)
Transformer-based models can produce biased outputs due to their training data. (True)
Reflection Activity:
In 150–200 words, discuss the ethical considerations of deploying NLP models in the cloud. Provide examples of challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias) and suggest strategies to address them.

Summary:
This assignment will test your understanding of:

The fundamentals and evolution of NLP.
Real-world applications of transformer models.
Ethical considerations of cloud-based NLP solutions.
