Assignment: Exploring String Methods
Hey there, string wrangler!
Strings are one of the most exciting parts of Python, and this assignment is all about diving deep into them. Get ready to slice, dice, and manipulate strings like a pro!

Task 1 - String Slicing and Indexing

Create a string variable with the value "Python is amazing!".
Extract the following using slicing:
The first 6 characters ("Python")
The word "amazing"
The entire string in reverse order
Print each of these slices with a clear label.
Example Output:

First word: Python
Amazing part: amazing
Reversed string: !gnizama si nohtyP
Task 2 - String Methods

Create a string with the value " hello, python world! ".
Use the following string methods and print the results:
strip() to remove extra spaces
capitalize() to capitalize the first letter
replace() to replace "world" with "universe"
upper() to convert the string to uppercase
Task 3 - Check for Palindromes
Write a Python program to check if a string is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward).

Ask the user to input a word.
Use slicing to reverse the string and compare it with the original.
Print a friendly message indicating whether the word is a palindrome.
Example Run:

Enter a word: madam
Yes, 'madam' is a palindrome!
