Assignment: About Parameters of Functions
Hello, Python Prodigy!
Functions and recursion are powerful tools that let us write reusable, efficient, and elegant code. Letâ€™s dive into these concepts with some engaging tasks. 

Task 1 - Writing Functions
Create a function greet_user that accepts a name as a parameter and prints a personalized greeting.
Then, write another function add_numbers that takes two numbers as parameters, adds them, and returns the result.

Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Hello, Alice! Welcome aboard. The sum of 5 and 10 is 15.
Task 2 - Using Default Parameters
Create a function describe_pet that accepts two parameters:

pet_name (string)
animal_type (string, default value is "dog").
The function should print a description of the pet.

Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
I have a dog named Buddy. I have a cat named Whiskers.
Task 3 - Functions with Variable Arguments
Write a function make_sandwich that accepts a variable number of arguments for sandwich ingredients and prints them as a list.

Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Making a sandwich with the following ingredients: - Lettuce - Tomato - Cheese
Task 4 - Understanding Recursion
Write a recursive function factorial to calculate the factorial of a number.
Then, write another recursive function fibonacci to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Factorial of 5 is 120. The 6th Fibonacci number is 8.
