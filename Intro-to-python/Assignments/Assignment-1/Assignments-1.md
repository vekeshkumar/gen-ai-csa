Assignment: Exploring Python Concepts
Hey there!
Welcome to your first Python assignment! ðŸŽ‰ This is where the real fun begins. Today, weâ€™ll practice the fundamentals: variables, operators, and conditional statements. By the end of this assignment, youâ€™ll feel like a mini Python pro!

Hereâ€™s what you need to do:

Task 1 - Variables: Your First Python Intro
Letâ€™s start simple! Imagine youâ€™re describing yourself (or anyone else you like) using Python variables.

Create a name variable that stores a string (like your name or a fictional characterâ€™s name).
Create an age variable that stores an integer value.
Create a height variable that stores a floating-point number.
For example, something like this:

name = "Alex"
age = 25
height = 5.9
Now print these variables in a friendly message:

Example Output: "Hey there, my name is Alex! Iâ€™m 25 years old and 5.9 feet tall."
Feel free to get creative with the message! ðŸš€

Task 2 - Operators: Playing with Numbers
We all love some math, donâ€™t we? Okay, maybe not everyone, but trust me, this will be easy and fun!

Pick two numbers, letâ€™s say num1 and num2 (you choose the values!).
Perform the following operations on these numbers:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Write your Python code to calculate and display the results with a nice message for each.
For example:

num1 = 10
num2 = 3
print("The sum of 10 and 3 is", num1 + num2)
Be sure to explain what youâ€™re doing in comments! Bonus points if you throw in some humor. ðŸ˜„

Task 3 - Conditional Statements: The Number Checker
Now for the real challenge: letâ€™s make your code think!

Write a program that takes a number from the user and tells them whether itâ€™s positive, negative, or zero.
Hereâ€™s how it should work:

Ask the user to enter a number (use the input() function).
Use if, elif, and else statements to check:
If the number is greater than 0, print: "This number is positive. Awesome!"
If the number is less than 0, print: "This number is negative. Better luck next time!"
If the number is exactly 0, print: "Zero it is. A perfect balance!"
Make sure to test your code with a few different numbers. Youâ€™ll be surprised how fun it is to see your program come to life! ðŸ’»âœ¨
