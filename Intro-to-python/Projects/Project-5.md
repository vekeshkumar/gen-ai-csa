Project: About Menu functioning
In this project, youâ€™ll create a Python program that showcases the beauty of recursion and the functionality of functions through a set of interactive and practical examples.

Step 1: Menu of Recursive Functions
Create a program that presents a menu of choices:

Calculate the factorial of a number.
Find the nth Fibonacci number.
Draw a recursive fractal pattern (bonus).
Exit.
The user should select an option by entering a number.

Step 2: Factorial Function
Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number and display the result.
Example Run:

plaintext
Copy code
Enter a number to find its factorial: 5 The factorial of 5 is 120.
Step 3: Fibonacci Function
Implement a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number and display the result.
Example Run:

plaintext
Copy code
Enter the position of the Fibonacci number: 7 The 7th Fibonacci number is 13.
Step 4: Recursive Fractal Pattern (Bonus)
Using the turtle library, create a recursive function to draw a fractal pattern (e.g., a tree or snowflake).
Example Run: A simple fractal tree drawing! ðŸŒ³

Step 5: User-Friendly Program
Enhance the program with the following features:

Input validation (e.g., check for positive integers).
Friendly prompts and error messages.
Comments explaining the purpose of each function.
Example Run:

plaintext
Copy code
Welcome to the Recursive Artistry Program! Choose an option: 1. Calculate Factorial 2. Find Fibonacci 3. Draw a Recursive Fractal 4. Exit > 1 Enter a number to find its factorial: 5 The factorial of 5 is 120.
