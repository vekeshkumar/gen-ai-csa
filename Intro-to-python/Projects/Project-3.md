Project: Password Strength Checker
Time to Get Practical! 🔒
In this project, you’ll create a program to check the strength of a password. The goal is to make it informative and interactive.

Step 1: Input the Password
Ask the user to input a password. Use the input() function for this.

Step 2: Evaluate the Password
Check the password for the following:

Length: It should be at least 8 characters.
Contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character (like @, #, $).
Print appropriate messages for each check:
If it passes all checks, print: "Your password is strong! 💪"
If it fails any check, print a message like: "Your password needs at least one digit."
Use Python string methods like isupper(), islower(), isdigit(), and others to perform these checks.

Step 3: Test with Different Passwords
Here’s how the program should behave:

Example Run 1:

Enter a password: python123
Your password needs at least one uppercase letter and one special character.
Example Run 2:

Enter a password: Python@123
Your password is strong! 💪
Bonus Challenge:
Add a "password strength meter" that gives a score out of 10 based on how strong the password is.

Make sure your program is clear, friendly, and fun to use
