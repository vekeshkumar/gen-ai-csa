Project: Calculator with Exception Handling
In this project, you will create a Python calculator that gracefully handles exceptions and provides helpful feedback to users.

Step 1: Menu of Operations
Create a program that displays a menu with the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Exit
The user should select an option by entering a number.

Step 2: Input Validation
Add input validation to ensure the user enters numbers only for the calculations. If the input is invalid, catch the exception and prompt the user again.

Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Enter the first number: abc Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.
Step 3: Division with Exception Handling
Handle the following exceptions specifically for the division operation:

ZeroDivisionError: Print a friendly message when dividing by zero.
ValueError: Ensure the inputs are numbers.
Example Output:

plaintext
Copy code
Enter the first number: 10 Enter the second number: 0 Oops! Division by zero is not allowed.
Step 4: Logging Errors (Bonus)
Use the logging module to log errors to a file named error_log.txt whenever an exception occurs.
Example Log Entry:

plaintext
Copy code
ERROR:root:ZeroDivisionError occurred: division by zero.
Step 5: User-Friendly Interface
Enhance the program with the following features:

Clear prompts and instructions.
A try...except...else...finally structure to ensure robustness.
Informative error messages for each exception.
Example Run:

plaintext
Copy code
Welcome to the Error-Free Calculator! Choose an operation: 1. Addition 2. Subtraction 3. Multiplication 4. Division 5. Exit > 4 Enter the first number: 10 Enter the second number: 0 Oops! Division by zero is not allowed. Choose an operation: 5 Goodbye!
Happy debugging and exception handling!
