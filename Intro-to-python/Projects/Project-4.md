Project: Implement Your own Data Structures
Let's Get Real! ðŸ›’
In this project, youâ€™ll create a simple inventory management program using lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

Step 1: Create the Inventory

Start with an empty dictionary called inventory.
Each key in the dictionary will represent an item name, and the value will be a tuple containing the quantity and price.
Example:

inventory =
{
"apple": (10, 2.5),
"banana": (20, 1.2)
}
Step 2: Add, Remove, and Update Items

Add functionality to:
Add a new item to the inventory (e.g., "mango": (15, 3.0)).
Remove an item from the inventory.
Update the quantity or price of an existing item.
Step 3: Display the Inventory
Write a loop to display all items in the inventory in a friendly format. For example:

Item: apple, Quantity: 10, Price: $2.5
Item: banana, Quantity: 20, Price: $1.2
Step 4: Bonus - Calculate Total Value
Add a feature to calculate and display the total value of the inventory by multiplying the quantity and price of each item.

Example Run:

Welcome to the Inventory Manager!
Current inventory:
Item: apple, Quantity: 10, Price: $2.5
Item: banana, Quantity: 20, Price: $1.2
Adding a new item: mango
Updated inventory:
Item: apple, Quantity: 10, Price: $2.5
Item: banana, Quantity: 20, Price: $1.2
Item: mango, Quantity: 15, Price: $3.0
Total value of inventory: $90.0
