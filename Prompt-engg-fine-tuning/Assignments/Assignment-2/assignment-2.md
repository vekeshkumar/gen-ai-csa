Assignment: Applying Concepts from Lessons
Assignment Objectives:
By completing this assignment, you should be able to:

Understand the techniques in prompt optimization and debugging.
Identify and fix common prompt failures.
Evaluate the effectiveness of prompts using structured metrics.
Apply prompt engineering skills to real-world tasks creatively and effectively.
Part 1: Techniques in Prompt Optimization
Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions):
Which of the following is the most effective way to improve prompt clarity?

A) Use technical jargon to make it sound professional.
B) Provide detailed instructions and examples.
C) Keep the prompt vague for flexibility.
D) Add multiple tasks in a single prompt. (Correct Answer: B)
What does it mean to "assign the AI a role" in a prompt?

A) Restrict the AI to only answering certain types of queries.
B) Guide the AI’s tone and perspective by specifying a persona.
C) Limit the AI to processing specific datasets.
D) Define a maximum word count for the response. (Correct Answer: B)
Application Task:
Write a basic prompt for generating a product description for a smartphone.
Refine this prompt using the following techniques:
Add role-based instructions.
Include an example to guide the AI.
Specify tone and length.
Reflection:
In 150–200 words, explain how prompt optimization could streamline a task you frequently perform (e.g., writing emails, generating reports, brainstorming ideas).

Part 2: Debugging Prompt Failures
Concept Check (True/False):
A prompt that is too broad or vague is more likely to produce irrelevant responses. (True)
Debugging prompts involves refining the AI model, not the input provided. (False)
Application Task:
Write an intentionally vague or complex prompt (e.g., “Write a story about life.”).
Analyze the AI’s response:
Identify two specific issues with the output.
Refine the prompt using debugging techniques (e.g., breaking the task into smaller steps, providing context).
Test the refined prompt and compare the new output to the original.
Case Study Activity:
Evaluate the following prompt:
"Describe a scientific concept in detail."

What’s wrong with this prompt?
Write a revised version using specific instructions and role-based guidance.
Reflection:
Describe a real-world situation where a poorly crafted prompt could cause problems. How would you apply debugging techniques to resolve this?

Part 3: Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness
Concept Check (Fill in the Blank):
To evaluate prompt effectiveness, key metrics include ______, ______, and ______. (Answer: relevance, clarity, completeness)
A response’s ______ measures how well it aligns with the task’s requirements, while ______ assesses whether all parts of the request are addressed. (Answer: relevance, completeness)
Application Task:
Create a prompt to generate a short email inviting coworkers to a weekend team-building event.
Use these metrics to evaluate the AI’s response:
Relevance
Completeness
Clarity
Accuracy
Creativity
Efficiency
Score the response for each metric on a 1–5 scale. Reflect on how you could refine the prompt to improve any weak areas.
Activity:
Evaluate and improve the following prompt:
"Generate a summary of this document."

Identify what’s missing or unclear.
Rewrite the prompt to include:
Specific instructions.
Context or examples.
A required length or focus.
Reflection:
In 150–200 words, describe how evaluating prompt effectiveness can improve productivity or reduce errors in your work or studies.

Summary:
This assignment will test your understanding of:

How to design, refine, and optimize prompts for clarity and specificity.
Debugging techniques to resolve common prompt failures.
Evaluating AI outputs using structured metrics to ensure high-quality results.
Happy Learning and Prompt Crafting!
