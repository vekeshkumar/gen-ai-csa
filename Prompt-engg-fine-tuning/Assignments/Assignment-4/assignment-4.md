Assignment: Advanced Techniques, Ethics, and RLHF in LLMs
Assignment Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will:

Understand the principles and applications of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) for aligning LLMs with human values.
Apply advanced prompt engineering techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and prompt injection.
Identify biases in LLM outputs and design strategies to mitigate them.
Explore ethical implications of fine-tuned models and learn to craft responsible AI prompts.
Part 1: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)
Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions)
What is the primary purpose of using RLHF in LLMs?

A) To improve computational efficiency.
B) To align model outputs with human values and expectations.
C) To reduce the size of training datasets.
D) To avoid using pre-trained models.
(Correct Answer: B)
Which algorithm is commonly used for fine-tuning models with RLHF?

A) Gradient Descent
B) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
C) Adam Optimizer
D) K-Means Clustering
(Correct Answer: B)
Application Task
Write a detailed explanation (150–200 words) of the RLHF process, covering the following steps:
Generating outputs
Collecting human feedback
Training the reward model
Fine-tuning the LLM
List three practical applications of RLHF in industries like healthcare, customer service, or creative writing. Include one example for each domain.
Reflection
Explain one challenge in scaling RLHF (e.g., subjectivity of feedback, cost of human evaluations) and propose a potential solution.

Part 2: Advanced Prompt Engineering
Application Task
Chain-of-Thought Prompting:
Write a CoT prompt for a logic-heavy task (e.g., solving a math problem or analyzing a case study).
Generate an AI response using the prompt and evaluate whether the step-by-step reasoning improves the clarity of the output.
Prompt Injection:
Design a prompt for a customer service chatbot. Include static instructions and inject dynamic inputs based on a user’s query (e.g., handling a product refund request).
Domain-Specific Prompts:
Create three prompts tailored for healthcare, legal, and creative writing domains. For each, specify the tone, structure, and expected output.
Reflection
In 150–200 words, discuss how advanced prompt engineering can make LLMs more adaptable across different industries.

Part 3: Ethical Considerations in LLMs
Application Task
Identifying and Mitigating Bias:
Provide an example of a biased prompt and its output.
Write a revised version of the prompt to remove the bias.
Fine-Tuned Models in Sensitive Applications:
Choose a sensitive domain (e.g., finance or healthcare).
List three potential risks of deploying a fine-tuned LLM in this field and propose mitigation strategies.
Crafting Responsible Prompts:
Write a prompt for a potentially controversial topic (e.g., climate change, global conflicts) that ensures neutrality, inclusivity, and ethical considerations.
Reflection
In 150–200 words, explain why ethical considerations are critical for building trust in AI systems.
