Assignment: Fine-Tuning Theory and Practice
Assignment Objectives
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

Explain the advantages and limitations of fine-tuning.
Prepare a dataset for fine-tuning by cleaning and curating it effectively.
Describe the process of transfer learning in the context of LLMs.
Fine-tune a lightweight LLM on a specific task using Python and Hugging Face.
Evaluate the performance of a fine-tuned model using appropriate metrics.
Part 1: Theory of Fine-Tuning
Concept Check (Multiple Choice Questions)
What is the main benefit of fine-tuning an LLM?

A) It improves the model’s speed.
B) It customizes the model for specific tasks or domains.
C) It eliminates the need for high-quality datasets.
D) It prevents overfitting entirely.
(Correct Answer: B)
Which of the following describes "catastrophic forgetting"?

A) When the model forgets its pre-training data during inference.
B) When the model loses its generalization ability after excessive fine-tuning on a specific task.
C) When the model produces irrelevant outputs due to overfitting.
D) When the model fails to save fine-tuned weights.
(Correct Answer: B)
Application Task
Write a 150–200 word explanation of transfer learning using a real-world analogy. Use examples from any domain (e.g., healthcare, legal, e-commerce).
Provide an example dataset structure for a fine-tuning task of your choice. Label and clean your dataset to match the requirements for the task.
Part 2: Practical Fine-Tuning Session
Hands-On Coding Task
Fine-tune the distilbert-base-uncased model for text classification using Hugging Face, as demonstrated in the lesson. Complete the following steps:

Environment Setup: Write the commands to install the required libraries and verify GPU availability.
Preprocessing Data: Demonstrate how to load and preprocess the IMDB dataset for tokenization.
Model Training: Define the training arguments and use Hugging Face’s Trainer to fine-tune the model.
Save and Evaluate: Save the fine-tuned model and evaluate its accuracy on the test set.
Reflection
Summarize the key challenges you faced during the fine-tuning process and how you addressed them.
Provide suggestions for improving the model’s performance if the accuracy was below 90%.
Good luck with your assignments and projects! Happy fine-tuning!
