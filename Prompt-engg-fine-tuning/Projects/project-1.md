Project: Putting Your LLM Knowledge to Work
Welcome to the project section! This is where you‚Äôll take the concepts from our lessons and apply them to real-world scenarios. These projects are designed to deepen your understanding and give you hands-on experience with LLMs. Whether you're new to this or already familiar, the projects have something for everyone. Let‚Äôs get started!

Project 1: Exploring Tokenization and Embeddings
Objective: Understand how text is broken down and represented numerically by LLMs.

Tasks:

Choose a short paragraph (100‚Äì150 words) from any book, article, or web page.
Tokenize the text using any tool (e.g., Python‚Äôs transformers library or an online tokenizer).
Analyze the tokens:
How many tokens does your text have?
Do any words split into subwords? If so, which ones?
Visualize embeddings:
Use a pre-trained model (e.g., GPT or BERT) to extract embeddings for a few tokens.
Plot the embeddings in a 2D or 3D space using a tool like t-SNE or PCA.
Project 2: Crafting the Perfect Prompt
Objective: Hone your prompt engineering skills by designing effective instructions.

Tasks:

Create three different prompts for the same task (e.g., summarizing an article or generating a story).
Write one generic prompt.
Write one detailed prompt with context.
Write one highly specific prompt with clear instructions and boundaries.
Test your prompts using an LLM and compare the outputs.
Which prompt gave the most accurate or useful result?
What changes improved performance?
Refine your prompts based on feedback from the model.
Project 3: Building a Mini Application
Objective: Use LLMs to create a small application that solves a practical problem.

Tasks:

Choose an application idea (e.g., a chatbot, content generator, or FAQ assistant).
Plan the workflow:
Define the input (e.g., user query).
Specify the output (e.g., a summary, generated content, or classification).
Develop your app using tools like Python, Streamlit, or Google Colab.
Include tokenization and embeddings in your pipeline.
Fine-tune your prompts for optimal results.
Test your application with different inputs to ensure it works smoothly.
Project 4: Advanced Prompt Techniques
Objective: Experiment with advanced strategies to maximize LLM performance.

Tasks:

Choose a task that requires nuanced responses (e.g., generating poetry or answering technical questions).
Apply advanced prompt techniques:
Chain of Thought Prompting: Break down the task into smaller steps.
Few-Shot Learning: Include examples in your prompt to guide the model.
Role Play: Ask the model to take on a specific persona (e.g., ‚ÄúAct as a historian and explain the significance of the Renaissance.‚Äù).
Compare the results with standard prompting methods.
Document your findings:
What advanced techniques did you try?
How did they affect the quality of the output?
Good luck! üéâ Remember, these projects are your chance to get creative and explore the amazing potential of LLMs. Have fun, and happy building!
