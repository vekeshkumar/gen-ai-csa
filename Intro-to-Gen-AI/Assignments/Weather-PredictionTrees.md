Project: Decision Trees
Weather Prediction Project with Decision Trees
This project is designed to help you apply decision trees for weather prediction in a simple and structured way. You will build, debug, and evaluate a decision tree model to classify or predict weather conditions.

Objective
Build a decision tree for weather prediction.
Debug issues in the model or data.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using basic metrics.
Part 1: Building the Decision Tree
Task: Build a decision tree model to predict weather conditions.

Choose a dataset:

Examples: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
Use a public dataset or create a small custom dataset.
Preprocess the data:

Handle missing values and normalize numerical features.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the decision tree:

Use a library like sklearn to create the model.
Fit the model on the training data.
Part 2: Debugging Issues
Task: Identify and resolve problems with the decision tree model.

Test for overfitting or underfitting:

Analyze training vs. testing accuracy.
Debug common issues:

Adjust the tree depth or minimum samples per split.
Balance the dataset if necessary.
Part 3: Evaluating the Model
Task: Use basic metrics to assess performance.

Generate predictions on the test set.
Evaluate using these metrics:
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision/Recall: For imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: To understand prediction errors.
Final Notes
This project is designed to keep things simple while demonstrating the effectiveness of decision trees for weather prediction. Focus on understanding the basics and refining the model iteratively. Good luck!
