Project: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Objective
Use the techniques from this module to:

Build and optimize a CNN for binary classification.
Debug issues in the model's architecture, training process, or data.
Evaluate the performance of the CNN using structured metrics.
Part 1: Building and Optimizing a CNN
Task: Design and refine a CNN for binary classification.

Choose a dataset for binary classification:

Examples: Cats vs. Dogs (image classification), Spam vs. Not Spam (text classification), or Healthy vs. Diseased (medical imaging).
Build the initial CNN model:

Create a basic architecture with a few convolutional and pooling layers.
Use appropriate activation functions (e.g., ReLU for hidden layers, sigmoid for the output layer).
Refine the architecture:

Experiment with deeper networks, dropout layers, or regularization techniques.
Tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer.
Train the model and compare versions:

Test multiple architectures and optimization settings.
Track accuracy and loss to evaluate improvements.
Part 2: Debugging Model Failures
Task: Identify and resolve issues in the CNN training process.

Train a problematic model:

Intentionally introduce issues like overfitting, underfitting, or poor data preprocessing.
Analyze the performance:

Review training and validation accuracy/loss curves.
Identify potential problems, such as vanishing gradients, data imbalance, or improper layer configurations.
Debug the issues:

Modify the architecture, improve data preprocessing, or adjust training parameters.
For example:
Add dropout layers or data augmentation to mitigate overfitting.
Normalize input data or add more layers to address underfitting.
Test the refined model:

Compare the results before and after debugging.
Part 3: Evaluating Model Effectiveness
Task: Use evaluation metrics to assess and refine your CNN.

Generate predictions on a test set:

Use the trained model to predict labels for unseen data.
Evaluate performance using these metrics:

Accuracy: Percentage of correctly predicted labels.
Precision: How many positive predictions were correct.
Recall: How many actual positives were identified correctly.
F1-Score: Balance of precision and recall.
AUC-ROC: Ability to distinguish between classes.
Refine the model:

Based on evaluation results, make further improvements (e.g., adjusting thresholds, rebalancing data).
Part 4: Creative Application
Task: Apply your CNN to solve a real-world binary classification problem.

Choose a creative classification task:

Examples:
Identify fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
Classify customer feedback as positive or negative.
Detect defective vs. non-defective products in manufacturing.
Build and optimize your CNN:

Experiment with advanced techniques like transfer learning using pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG).
Use techniques like early stopping or model checkpointing to enhance performance.
Debug and evaluate:

Troubleshoot the model as needed and evaluate its effectiveness using the metrics described earlier.
