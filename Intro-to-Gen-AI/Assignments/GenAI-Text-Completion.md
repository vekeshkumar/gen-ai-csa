Project: AI-Powered Text Completion
Project: AI-Powered Text Completion
This project introduces you to the basics of Generative AI by building a simple application for text completion. You will explore how Generative AI processes input prompts and produces relevant text outputs, helping you understand its capabilities and limitations.

Objective
Understand the basics of Generative AI and how it works.
Build an application to interact with a pre-trained AI model.
Experiment with different inputs to analyze and evaluate the model’s responses.
Part 1: Building the Application
Task: Set up and create a text completion application.
Set up the environment:

Install the necessary libraries and tools for accessing a pre-trained AI model.
Obtain an API key from a Generative AI provider.
Develop the application:

Write a script or use an interactive environment to send prompts to the AI model and display its responses.
Ensure the application can accept user input dynamically.
Test the application:

Run the application and provide various prompts like writing a poem, completing a sentence, or answering a question.
Part 2: Debugging Issues
Task: Identify and resolve common problems.
API Connectivity:

Ensure the application connects to the AI model service without issues.
Troubleshoot API key errors or connection timeouts.
Input Handling:

Validate user inputs to prevent empty or irrelevant prompts.
Ensure the application handles invalid responses gracefully.
Output Control:

Adjust parameters like the length and creativity of the response to achieve the desired output style.
Experiment with different settings to fine-tune the output.
Part 3: Evaluating the Application
Task: Experiment with the model’s behavior and analyze its outputs.
Test with Various Prompts:

Provide different types of prompts, such as:
Writing a creative story.
Summarizing a paragraph.
Explaining a concept in simple terms.
Observe how the AI adapts to different inputs.
Modify Parameters:

Experiment with settings that control the model’s behavior, such as response length and creativity, to understand their impact on the outputs.
Record Observations:

Document the responses for each prompt and evaluate the quality of the outputs.
Identify patterns or limitations in the AI’s understanding and generation capabilities.
Final Notes
This project provides a hands-on introduction to Generative AI through a simple and interactive text completion application. By experimenting with prompts and analyzing responses, you will gain insights into how AI models generate text and how to refine their outputs. Focus on understanding the fundamentals and enjoy exploring the potential of Generative AI!
