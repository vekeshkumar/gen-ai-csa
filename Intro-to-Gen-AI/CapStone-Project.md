Capstone Project: Building AI-Powered Solutions
Problem Statements as User Stories 

User Story 1: Task Automation with Supervised Learning 

As a student, I want to predict the likelihood of passing my exams based on my study habits and past scores so that I can adjust my study routine for better performance. 

Solution: Use a classification model to predict the likelihood of passing based on historical study data (e.g., hours studied, past scores). 
User Story 2: Clustering for Student Grouping 

As a teacher, I want to group students into different categories based on their learning styles so that I can tailor my teaching methods to each group. 

Solution: Apply K-means clustering to student performance data to identify different learning groups (e.g., fast learners, struggling students). 
User Story 3: Image Generation with GANs 

As a digital artist, I want to create new artwork using AI so that I can explore unique and creative designs for my projects. 

Solution: Implement a GAN to generate new, unique images based on a dataset of existing artwork.
